# Reproducible-NBA-DataAnalysis-Project
Scenario of this project is to act as a data analyst with the Chicago Bulls competing in the NBA(National Basketball Association). Chicago Bulls are not doing very well recently in the NBA, they are placed 27th out of 30 based on the win-loss record.
The budget allocated to the 2019-20 season is $118Million.

The job given to the data analyst is to find the best five [starting players](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions)Chicago Bulls can afford which can help to improve their ranking in the league and can challenge and aim to win the championship.

I have been provided with the 2018-19 season data that include the nba player statistics, player salary, team payroll and team statistics as well.

I strongly believe that data analysis will help in monitoring player performance, game strategy and above all the talent identification who is still within the budget range and can help the team to win the games. 

This project is very important because data gathering, data analysis of the Athletes can provide valuable insights that can help teams optimize player performance and develop game strategies that give them a competitive edge.
